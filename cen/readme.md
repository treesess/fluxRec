# cen = color, entity, and number

To be simple it is building references from numbers to channels (i.e., input and output of your mind), and additionally painting some colors on those numbers. A colorful dictionary. 

cen is NOT a necessary part of fluxRec. It is just the way she does because, of all the available digital symbols defined in the UTF-8, numbers are the most handy ones in her eyes. Martha chose to use numbers only (without letters) because numbers can do mathematical operations which means somehow the deep-level meanings can be given. 

Why color? i may talk about Synesthesia but that's not relevant.

## How does it feel dealing with cen every day

It feels like, developing a new language. i believe that everyone has the ability to create a new language and i've heard stories about two kids who created a language for fun, when they grew up and met again, surprisingly they can still speak in that language. So, it is really not a big deal. 

Rather say, it is pretty natural if you use cen daily. The numbers will develop and connect with one another on their own course. 

And you will see the meaning changing over time, just like every word has a history and its etymology. 

Fun experience, she'd comment.
