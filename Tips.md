**Figure**  Paste **values** only

since the conditional formatting should have been done before using the spreadsheet, basically you should only do "Paste **values** only" whenever you try to paste anything in the runtime spreadsheet. 

if you paste anything without clicking/tapping the "Paste **values** only" option, the original format will be erased, which very possibly makes the sheet ununiformed. But don't panic if this happens, since you can use the "Paste **format** only" function to amend the formatting by copying any good parts of the sheet to the damaged part.
