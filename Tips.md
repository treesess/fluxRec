**Figure**  Paste **values** only

since the conditional formatting should have been done before using the spreadsheet, basically you should only do "Paste **values** only" whenever you try to paste anything in the runtime spreadsheet. 

if you paste anything without clicking/tapping the "Paste **values** only" option, the original format will be erased, which very possibly makes the sheet ununiformed. But don't panic if this happens, since you can use the "Paste **format** only" function to amend the formatting by copying any good parts of the sheet to the damaged part. 



# tip 2

to be more precise about the fxR records timing related to the sleep part of your life, you may try using mobile screenshots when you are not fully awake, or about to fall asleep, or when wake up in the middle of the night to relieve your bladder. 

i myself use an Android phone and set a gesture to make a screenshot whenever i am not fully conscious. Afterwards when you are in a clear mind, refer to the screenshots which have timestamps, so you can make up the fxR records accordingly.
